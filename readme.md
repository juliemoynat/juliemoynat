# Welcome on my GitHub’s personal profile

I’m a French web designer and web accessibility consultant (pronoun she/her).

I mostly write articles [on my blog “La Lutine du Web”](https://www.lalutineduweb.fr/) (there are too few articles in English at the moment).

You would not see a lot of stuffs here because a lot of my personal work is in private repositories and business work is on a professional GitHub account.
