# Welcome on my GitHub’s personal profile

I’m a French web accessibility consultant and HTML/CSS web developer (pronoun she/her).

I mostly write articles in French [on my blog “La Lutine du Web”](https://www.lalutineduweb.fr/) (there are too few articles in English at the moment).

You may not see a lot of stuffs here because a lot of my personal work is in private repositories and business work is on my professional GitHub account [@juliemoynatPro](https://github.com/juliemoynatPro).
